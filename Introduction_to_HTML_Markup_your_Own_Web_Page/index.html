                <p>
                    I love fresh homemade bread. And though I bake bread with yeast more frequently nowadays,
                    I still find it easier and a general preference to make bread without yeast.&#128525;

                <h2>How to make Flatbread – with NO yeast</h2>
                <p>
                    This flatbread recipe is made with <b>no yeast</b>. It is <b>very easy to make</b>,
                    requiring just a minute or two of kneading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it honestly is beautifully soft and pliable. So soft you can use it as a wrap and it won’t
                    crack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’ve never tried homemade bread before, this flatbread recipe is a great one to start with
                    because
                    it really is that easy. The worst that can happen with this flatbread recipe is that the heat is too
                    high when you cook it so the exterior ends up a bit too crunchy and cracks when you roll it. If that
                    happens, just spray it with olive oil or brush lightly with oil or butter and it will moisten the
                    surface.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups / 300g plain flour (all purpose flour) (level cups, unsifted, not packed), + keep 1/4 cup
                    extra for dusting &#38; adjusting dough.</li>
                <li>&#189; tsp salt.</li>
                <li>3&#189; tbsp / 50g butter (1.75 oz).</li>
                <li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup / 185 ml milk</li>
                <li>&#189; tbsp oil (for cooking)</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine butter and milk and heat until butter is just melted - on stove or in microwave.
                </li>
                <li>Combine 2 cups flour, salt, butter and milk.</li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle work surface with flour then knead for a few minutes until it is smooth - it doesn't need
                    much kneading. Add extra flour if the dough is too sticky.
                </li>
                <li>Wrap with cling wrap and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Dust bench top with flour, cut dough into 4 pieces, roll into balls, then roll out into about
                    1/8&Prime; / 0.3cm thick rounds.</li>
                <li>Heat &#189; <abbr title="tablespoon" >tbsp</abbr> olive oil in a non stick pan over medium heat - or lower if you have a heavy based
                    skillet. (Note 1)</li>
                <li>Place one flatbread in the pan, cook for around 1 - 1&#189; minutes - it should bubble up, then flip
                    and cook the other side, pressing down if it puffs up. There should be a smallish golden brown spots
                    on both sides.
                </li>
                <li>Stack the cooked bread and keep wrapped with a tea towel - the moisture helps soften the surface,
                    making them even more pliable.
                </li>
                <li>Continue to cook with remaining pieces.</li>
                <li>Optional: Brush or spray bread with olive oil or melted butter, for a more luxurious finish. Or even
                    with melted butter mixed with minced garlic for a garlic butter version!
                </li>
