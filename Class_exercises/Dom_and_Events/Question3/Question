For this assignment you will be combining your knowledge of DOM access and events to build a todo app!
As a user, you should be able to:
Add a new todo (by submitting a form)
Mark a todo as completed (cross out the text of the todo)
Remove a todo

Using localStorage, try to store your todos so that if you refresh the page you do not lose what you have added to 
the list! As a super bonus, try to also save todos that you have marked as complete!
