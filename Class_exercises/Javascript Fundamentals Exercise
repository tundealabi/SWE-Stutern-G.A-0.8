PART 1
1. let name = “jake”, dayOfBirth = 25;
2. The last variable takes precedence.(except you use const).
3. let response = prompt("Please enter your favourite color");
   const reply = resp => console.log(`Hi, Your favourite color is ${resp.toUpperCase()}.`);
   reply(response);

4. "Hi There! " + "It's "sunny" out"  = "Hi There! " + "It's \"sunny\" out".
5. Undefined: refers to a declared variable with no assigned value. E.g, let name;
    Null: This is an assignment value, i.e, you can assign it to a variable therefore making it
    explicitly empty(blank). E.g, var name = null;

6. NaN: Not a Number. The data type is number.

7. Undefined.


PART 2

1. true.
2. true.
3. 1.
4. true.
5. false.
6. true.
7. true.




PART 3
A.
1. “Keep it up”.
2. The if statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy.

B.
1. “third”. This is because firstVariable and secondVariable are falsy and the if statement will only run if the 
   specified condition is truthy. You can interpret the the if statement with the block of code of console.log(“third”) 
   like this - - - if(false || true) and this will return true.
2. firstVariable will have a value of undefined.
3. The value of firstVariable is not a truthy value but rather a falsy value because it returns undefined
4. The value of secondVariable is also not a truthy value but a falsy one because its value is an empty string.
5. The value of thirdVariable is a truthy value because it has a defined value or was initialized with a defined value.


PART 4
1. (function (num=0.5){
let value = Math.random();
    if(value > num){
     console.log(`Over ${num}`,value.toPrecision(2));
 }else{
 	console.log(`Under ${num}`,value.toPrecision(2));
 }
})();

2. A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context. Falsy values include: keyword false, 0, Nan, undefined, null, -0, “” and 0n.
